# MozmoSampleBlaster

Sample Blaster is a dead simple sample scrubber made for Mozmo allowing a user to scrub and play a sample with a control signal.
Mozmo is a Eurorack module made by Jean-Luc Deladriere using the Mozzi sonification library on the arduino platform.

Samples must be converted to tables and loaded manually alongside the program. I will be developing an application for converting samples.
