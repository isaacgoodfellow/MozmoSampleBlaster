# MozmoSampleBlaster

_SampleBlaster_ is a dead simple hardware sample scrubber made for the _Mozmo_ Eurorack module allowing a user to scrub and play a sample with a 0-5v cv signal. 
Samples must be converted to tables and loaded manually alongside the program. I wrote a [Downsampler](https://github.com/isaacgoodfellow/ArduinoWavetableDownsampler) just for this.

### Usage

_Installing Arduino and Mozzi_
> - Download the Arduino software, and Mozzi library
> - Edit your Mozzi settings to use HI-FI audio, this is found in the MozziGuts.h file in the library

_Programming the Mozmo_
> - Switch on your system, and with no jacks connected to the _Mozmo_, upload this sketch
> - Patch Audio out of `"Audio"` jack
> - Patch CV Signal into `A2` jack

The output of the mozmo is fairly low, I usually to boost it with channel 2 or 3 of the MakeNoise maths.


### Troubleshooting

_I just get a bunch of noise_

It is possible you have not enabled HI-FI mode in your MozziGuts.h file

### A Word of Caution
There are blocking diodes on the inputs of the _Mozmo_, but I would excercise caution in what signals you feed it. (Avoid negative polarity and voltages over 5v when possible).

As Mozmo can be built as a DIY project there are a variety of ways you could screw it up. This program functions safely in my system with my Mozmo that I built myself, and if you built yours right it should function right in your system as well. That said I am not liable for any damage caused to your system through running this sketch. If your Mozmo works with other sketches, then it will work with this.

### About Mozmo
[Mozmo](http://elek101.blogspot.com/2015/01/mozmo-brilliant-arduino-mozzi-synth-in.html) is a Eurorack module made by Jean-Luc Deladriere using the Mozzi sonification library on the arduino platform.
